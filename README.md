## Introduction

### Description

The **Code Reviewer API** provides a unified interface for integrating data from **GitHub** and **Jira** to enhance code review processes. It allows users to retrieve and analyze information related to pull requests, code reviews, comments, reviewers, and associated Jira issues. This API demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate multiple data sources using SQL queries within the RAW platform, streamlining workflows and improving collaboration.

### How It Works

The RAW platform enables the creation of APIs by writing SQL queries that can access data from various sources, including GitHub and Jira. By leveraging these capabilities, the Code Reviewer API allows for real-time data retrieval and analysis without the need for data replication. The API facilitates interactions with GitHub pull requests and Jira issues, providing a consolidated view of the code review lifecycle.

## Domain Entities

### Entities Overview

The Code Reviewer API focuses on key entities involved in code review processes:

- **Pull Request (PR)**: A proposed change to a repository, including code changes, discussions, and reviews.
- **PR Comment**: Feedback or discussion points made on a pull request.
- **PR Review**: Formal reviews of a pull request, which may include approvals, change requests, or comments.
- **Reviewer**: Users assigned to review a pull request.
- **Jira Issue**: Tasks, bugs, or feature requests tracked in Jira, often associated with specific code changes.
- **Assignee**: The person responsible for a Jira issue.

### Entity Relationships

The entities are interconnected to provide a comprehensive view of the code review process:

- A **Pull Request** may be linked to one or more **Jira Issues** via references in the PR title or description.
- **PR Comments** and **PR Reviews** are associated with specific **Pull Requests**.
- **Reviewers** are assigned to **Pull Requests** to perform code reviews.
- **Jira Issues** may be associated with multiple **Pull Requests** if multiple code changes are related to the same issue.

WITH prs AS (
  SELECT
    pr.number AS pr_number,
    pr.title AS pr_title,
    pr.created_at AS pr_created_at,
    pr.updated_at AS pr_updated_at,
    pr.url AS pr_url,
    pr.state AS pr_state,
    pr.author ->> 'login' AS pr_author,
    REGEXP_MATCHES(pr.title, '([A-Z]+-[0-9]+)', 'g') AS jira_keys
  FROM
    github.github_pull_request AS pr
  WHERE
    pr.repository_full_name = :github_repository_full_name
    AND (:github_pull_request_number IS NULL OR pr.number = :github_pull_request_number)
    AND (
      :is_github_pull_request_open IS NULL OR
      (:is_github_pull_request_open = TRUE AND pr.state = 'open') OR
      (:is_github_pull_request_open = FALSE AND pr.state != 'open')
    )
    AND pr.created_at BETWEEN :pr_creation_date_from AND :pr_creation_date_to
),

  SELECT
    prs.*,
    ji.key AS jira_issue_key,
    ji.summary AS jira_summary,
    ji.status AS jira_status,
    ji.assignee_display_name AS jira_assignee

FROM jira_pr
ORDER BY pr_number DESC
LIMIT COALESCE(:page_size, 25)
OFFSET (COALESCE(:page, 1) - 1) * COALESCE(:page_size, 25);
```

#### Specific Entity Queries

These queries focus on a specific entity, such as retrieving comments or reviews for a pull request.

**Example**:

```sql
-- @param github_repository_full_name GitHub repository name
-- @type github_repository_full_name varchar
-- @param github_pull_request_number GitHub pull request number
-- @type github_pull_request_number integer
-- @return Get Pull Request Comments

SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.number,
  c.published_at,
  c.created_at,
  c.body,
  c.author ->> 'login' AS author_username,
  c.can_delete
FROM
  github.github_pull_request_comment AS c
WHERE
  c.repository_full_name = :github_repository_full_name
  AND c.number = :github_pull_request_number;
```

## Filters and Pagination

### Filters

The API supports various filters to refine the data retrieved:

- **String Matching**: Filters based on matching strings, such as repository names, usernames, or issue keys.
- **Date Ranges**: Filters data within specified date ranges. Date parameters must not exceed a range of 15 days. If a date range exceeds this limit, the API will return an error message prompting the user to adjust the dates.
- **Boolean Flags**: Filters based on boolean parameters, such as `is_github_pull_request_open` or `is_without_pull_request`.
- **Numeric Ranges**: Filters based on numeric values, such as pull request numbers.

### Pagination

Pagination is implemented to manage large datasets and improve performance.

- **Parameters**:
  - `page` (integer): The current page number (default is 1).
  - `page_size` (integer): The number of records per page (default is 25).
- **Usage**:
  - The `LIMIT` clause is set to the `page_size`.
  - The `OFFSET` is calculated as `(page - 1) * page_size`.
- **Example**:

```sql
LIMIT COALESCE(:page_size, 25)
OFFSET (COALESCE(:page, 1) - 1) * COALESCE(:page_size, 25);
```

## Customization

The Code Reviewer API template is designed to be adaptable to various development workflows and repository structures:

- **Modify SQL Queries**: Adjust the provided SQL queries to include additional fields or entities specific to your GitHub and Jira setups.
- **Add New Endpoints**: Create new SQL and YAML files to define additional API endpoints as needed.
- **Adjust Parameters**: Modify or add parameters in the queries to support custom filters and data retrieval requirements.
- **Enhance Functionality**: Integrate additional data sources or services to extend the capabilities of the API.
